	in order to build/oversee the webapp, need to have a basic 
	 projMgmt plan to be able to keep the process for the app in 
	 check.
	the overall checklist is based on what the project/webapp needs
	what the steps are:
	 create the app, 
	 from "start" to "finish"

	the steps are used to have consistency, to make sure critical items 
	 aren't missed/skipped during the setup/dev/release/prod/post morteum
	 phases

	the idea is to map the checklists for the differnt parts of the 
	app create process, to the overall schedule.
 
	the overall projMgmt checklist might work with a projmgmt app as well
	the projMgmt checklist works with the other "checklist" apps

	team members are able to comment/doc/respond to comments during 
	 dev process/cycle


	description/comments/docs for any subfolders/files to 
	 give user understanding of how/why flow/logic of overall project
