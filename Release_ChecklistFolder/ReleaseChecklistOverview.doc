update

	The idea behind the Release process/ReleaseChecklist is to 
	 have a consistent process that helps the user/team minimize chances of 
	 missing something when setting up a comprehensive Release process/ 
	 env for the webapp.
	The ReleaseProcess/ReleaseChecklist works "after" the 
	 other checklists have completed/signed-off to create a 
	 "complete" env/instance/droplet that can run the webapp.
	The ReleaseChecklist - used to ensure the steps/items 
	 required to "run" the webapp are correct, and to reduce 
	 chances of "missing" something, or to be able to "backtrack" 
	 if something has gone wrong during the overall Release 
	 process for the app
	The ReleaseChecklist is intended to be run afer the checklists for 
	 the web/test/systemOps have been completed. The 
	 Monitoring/Security/Logging/etc.. and the remainng checklists can 
	 be handled in parallel (if they're used). 

	Once/after the releaseProcess is "completed" the "dev"/webapp 
	 droplet/system can be considered to be ready to release to run 
	 for users to access on the 'net

	The idea of the ReleaseProcess/ReleaseCheckList is to test/check off items 
	 similar to the items in the: 
		WebsiteChecklist/ProductionCheckList/ReleaseCheckList items

	Key areas/items
		Instance/Droplet creation process
		installed process/steps for any/all processes
		scripts required to setup/config instance
		ports/security setup
		user passwd/group access control/restrictions
		turn off/disable everything
		turn on/enable the minimum of what's required for 
		 the overall system
		setup monitoring/security/redundancy processes

		go through the steps in the:: 
			devProcessChecklist
			websiteChecklist
			testChecklist
			systemOpsChecklist

		define config/setup files
		inteface with external cron/security issues
		etc
		system setup.. cloud instance setup/clone/update/etc.

		in this checklist, 
			define the items to be checked -- for consistency..
			check items..
			
	 define what the "steps" are to be used during the 
		"release" process
	 ability to comment/reply
	 ability to add/mod repos for version control/branch policy

	the steps are used to have consistency, to make sure critical items 
	 aren't missed/skipped during the setup/dev/release/prod/post morteum
	 phases

	the idea is to map the checklists for the differnt parts of the 
	app create process, to the overall schedule.
 
	the overall ReleaseCheckList might work with a projmgmt app as well
	-the ReleaseCheckList works with the other "checklist" apps

	team members are able to comment/doc/respond to comments during 
	 dev process/cycle


	description/comments/docs for any subfolders/files to 
	 give user understanding of how/why flow/logic of overall project


	check off/test these items that they work/pass/fail
	modify scripts to setup the "Release" as required
	update github for checklist versions, 

	all prior Processes/checklists are tested, run, and are signed off
	duplicate/cloned instances tested/run

	=====================================================================


	once the website/app has gotten to a point where key 
	 UX/UI/logic/database functions are "working", it might be ok to 
	 start "checking" the overall Website, and using the/a 
	 WebsiteChecklist to check off what "works/doesn't work"

	The idea of the SystemOps is to test/check off items 
	 similar to the items in the: 
		WebsiteChecklist/ProductionCheckList/ReleaseCheckList items
	Key differences are that the items being tested/checked at this 
	 stage are expected to "work" correctly more of the time..
	 -broken items are/might be expected as this is kind of 
		iterative, but issues will be fewer in number
	 -focuses more on the actual code+system issues as well
	-might be useful to also have auto testing for the checklist items
	-checking/rechecking allows consistent progress to be handled/tracked
	-gives feedback on issues as well
	-checklist/strategy to be able to keep the process on track for 
	 the app in check.
	the overall checklist is based on what the project/webapp/dev/funcs/system need 
	 to implement/check off
	what the steps are:
	 during the dev/create/database app process,
	 for the initial setup process
	 for the dev steps
	 for database:
		define schema/layout
		define redundancy process/steps
		define sql/init data process
		define config/setup files
		inteface with external cron/security issues
		define/test db funcs to use in the app
		etc
		system setup.. cloud instance setup/clone/update/etc.

		in this checklist, 
			define the items to be checked -- for consistency..
			check items..
			
	 for the dev/testing func/unit testing/etc..
	 for... etc..
	 define what the "steps" are to be used during the 
		database/dev process
 	 define the internal/database/dev testing -- to add to checklist
	 ability to comment/reply
	 ability to add/mod repos for version control/branch policy

	the steps are used to have consistency, to make sure critical items 
	 aren't missed/skipped during the setup/dev/release/prod/post morteum
	 phases

	the idea is to map the checklists for the differnt parts of the 
	app create process, to the overall schedule.
 
	the overall TestCheckList might work with a projmgmt app as well
	-the TestCheckList works with the other "checklist" apps
