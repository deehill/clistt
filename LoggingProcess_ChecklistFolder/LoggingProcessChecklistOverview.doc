	The idea behind the LoggingChecklist is to have a consistent 
	 process that helps the user/team minimize chances of 
	 missing something when setting up a comprehensive Logging 
	 process/env/system for the webapp.
	The LoggingChecklist works "after"/"in parallel" with the 
	 other checklists as they have completed/signed-off to create a 
	 "complete" Logging env for the instance/droplet that runs the 
	 webapp.
	The LoggingChecklist - used to ensure the steps/items 
	 required to "run" the webapp are correct, and that the 
	 steps/processes use to "Log" the instance/droplet/app(s) 
	 work correctly

	The LoggingChecklist is indended to be modified as needed. This 
	 reduces chances of "missing" something, or to be able to "backtrack" 
	 if something has gone wrong during the overall Logging 
	 process for the app. 
	The LoggingChecklist should be run as the other checklists for 
	 the web/test/prod/systemOps "are run"/"have been completed".

	The DNS/Rollback/Threat/Release processes/checklists etc.., can 
	 be handled in parallel (if they're used). 

	Once/after the LoggingProcess is "working" correctly, the overall 
	 instance/cloud env can be used to complete the rest of the checklists 
	 if they're part of the app creation/release process.
	LoggingProcess works for the ops/system processes, when the defined 
	 actions/processes are able to be "triggered" and captured in the 
	 logging process..
	 needs to be defined for the actions to "log" as well as tested

	The idea of the Logging is to test/check off items 
	 similar to:
		cloud instance
		webapp/funcs
		supporting processes (from apt/yum/etc..)
		security updates
		database
		user access/control
		ports
		system services
		turn off everything not needed
		turn on only things required
		have monitoring apps/clients/crons

		Instance/Droplet creation process
		installed process/steps for any/all processes
		scripts required to setup/config instance
		ports/security setup
		user passwd/group access control/restrictions
		turn off/disable everything
		turn on/enable the minimum of what's required for 
		 the overall system
		etc..

		go through the steps in the:: 
			devProcessChecklist
			websiteChecklist
			testChecklist
			systemOpsChecklist

		define config/setup files
		inteface with external cron/security issues
		etc
		system setup.. cloud instance setup/clone/update/etc.

		in this checklist, 
			define the items to be checked -- for consistency..
			check items..
			
	 define what the "steps" are to be used during the 
		"Logging" process
	 ability to comment/reply
	 ability to add/mod repos for version control/branch policy

	the steps are used to have consistency, to make sure critical items 
	 aren't missed/skipped during the setup/dev/release/prod/post morteum
	 phases

	the idea is to map the checklists for the differnt parts of the 
	app create process, to the overall schedule.
 
	the overall LoggingCheckList might work with a projmgmt app as well
	-the LoggingCheckList works with the other "checklist" apps

	team members are able to comment/doc/respond to comments during 
	 dev process/cycle

	description/comments/docs for any subfolders/files to 
	 give user understanding of how/why flow/logic of overall project


	check off/test these items that they work/pass/fail
	modify scripts to setup the "Logging" as required
	update github for checklist versions, 

	=====================================================================



	once the website/app has gotten to a point where key 
	 UX/UI/logic/database functions are "working", it might be ok to 
	 start "checking" the overall Website, and using the/a 
	 WebsiteChecklist to check off what "works/doesn't work"

	The idea of the SystemOps is to test/check off items 
	 similar to the items in the: 
		WebsiteChecklist/ProductionCheckList/ReleaseCheckList items
	Key differences are that the items being tested/checked at this 
	 stage are expected to "work" correctly more of the time..
	 -broken items are/might be expected as this is kind of 
		iterative, but issues will be fewer in number
	 -focuses more on the actual code+system issues as well
	-might be useful to also have auto testing for the checklist items
	-checking/rechecking allows consistent progress to be handled/tracked
	-gives feedback on issues as well
	-checklist/strategy to be able to keep the process on track for 
	 the app in check.
	the overall checklist is based on what the project/webapp/dev/funcs/system need 
	 to implement/check off
	what the steps are:
	 during the dev/create/database app process,
	 for the initial setup process
	 for the dev steps
	 for database:
		define schema/layout
		define redundancy process/steps
		define sql/init data process
		define config/setup files
		inteface with external cron/security issues
		define/test db funcs to use in the app
		etc
		system setup.. cloud instance setup/clone/update/etc.

		in this checklist, 
			define the items to be checked -- for consistency..
			check items..
			
	 for the dev/testing func/unit testing/etc..
	 for... etc..
	 define what the "steps" are to be used during the 
		database/dev process
 	 define the internal/database/dev testing -- to add to checklist
	 ability to comment/reply
	 ability to add/mod repos for version control/branch policy

	the steps are used to have consistency, to make sure critical items 
	 aren't missed/skipped during the setup/dev/release/prod/post morteum
	 phases

	the idea is to map the checklists for the differnt parts of the 
	app create process, to the overall schedule.
 
	the overall TestCheckList might work with a projmgmt app as well
	-the TestCheckList works with the other "checklist" apps

	team members are able to comment/doc/respond to comments during 
	 dev process/cycle
