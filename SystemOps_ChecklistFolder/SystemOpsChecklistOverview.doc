	The idea behind the SystemOpsChecklist is to have a consistent 
	 process that gives the user/team a process to minimize chances of 
	 missing something when setting up a comprehensive dev/prod/release 
	 env for the webapp.
	The SystemOpsChecklist works with/after/in parallel with the 
	 other checklists to create a "complete" env/instance that 
	 can run the webapp.
	The SystemOpsChecklist is used to are sure the steps/items 
	 required to create the right env for the webapp, and to reuce 
	 chances of "missing" something, or to be able to "backtrack" 
	 if something has gone wrong during the overall system/dev process 
	 for the app
	The SystemOpsChecklist will be iterative, and possibly automated 
	 to reduce time required to cover the items to success/fail. Once 
	 the SystemOpsChecklist "succeeds" the snapshot could be used as 
	 the basis for dev from then on.. provided nothing from the SystemOps  
	 process changes..
	Once/after the devProcess is "completed" the SystemOpsChecklist 
	 has to be rerun as part of the comprehensive check off process.

	The idea of the SystemOps is to test/check off items 
	 similar to the items in the: 
		WebsiteChecklist/ProductionCheckList/ReleaseCheckList items

	Key areas/items
		Instance/Droplet creation process
		installed process/steps for any/all processes
		scripts required to setup/config instance
		ports/security setup
		user passwd/group access control/restrictions
		turn off/disable everything
		turn on/enable the minimum of what's required for 
		 the overall system
		setup monitoring/security/redundancy processes

		define config/setup files
		inteface with external cron/security issues
		etc
		system setup.. cloud instance setup/clone/update/etc.

		in this checklist, 
			define the items to be checked -- for consistency..
			check items..
			
	 for the dev/testing func/unit testing/etc..
	 for... etc..
	 define what the "steps" are to be used during the 
		systemDevOps process
	 ability to comment/reply
	 ability to add/mod repos for version control/branch policy

	the steps are used to have consistency, to make sure critical items 
	 aren't missed/skipped during the setup/dev/release/prod/post morteum
	 phases

	the idea is to map the checklists for the differnt parts of the 
	app create process, to the overall schedule.
 
	the overall TestCheckList might work with a projmgmt app as well
	-the TestCheckList works with the other "checklist" apps

	team members are able to comment/doc/respond to comments during 
	 dev process/cycle


	description/comments/docs for any subfolders/files to 
	 give user understanding of how/why flow/logic of overall project


	check off/test these items that they work/pass/fail
	modify scripts to setup the "systemDevOps" as required
	update github for checklist versions, 

	=====================================================================


	once the website/app has gotten to a point where key 
	 UX/UI/logic/database functions are "working", it might be ok to 
	 start "checking" the overall Website, and using the/a 
	 WebsiteChecklist to check off what "works/doesn't work"

	The idea of the SystemOps is to test/check off items 
	 similar to the items in the: 
		WebsiteChecklist/ProductionCheckList/ReleaseCheckList items
	Key differences are that the items being tested/checked at this 
	 stage are expected to "work" correctly more of the time..
	 -broken items are/might be expected as this is kind of 
		iterative, but issues will be fewer in number
	 -focuses more on the actual code+system issues as well
	-might be useful to also have auto testing for the checklist items
	-checking/rechecking allows consistent progress to be handled/tracked
	-gives feedback on issues as well
	-checklist/strategy to be able to keep the process on track for 
	 the app in check.
	the overall checklist is based on what the project/webapp/dev/funcs/system need 
	 to implement/check off
	what the steps are:
	 during the dev/create/database app process,
	 for the initial setup process
	 for the dev steps
	 for database:
		define schema/layout
		define redundancy process/steps
		define sql/init data process
		define config/setup files
		inteface with external cron/security issues
		define/test db funcs to use in the app
		etc
		system setup.. cloud instance setup/clone/update/etc.

		in this checklist, 
			define the items to be checked -- for consistency..
			check items..
			
	 for the dev/testing func/unit testing/etc..
	 for... etc..
	 define what the "steps" are to be used during the 
		database/dev process
 	 define the internal/database/dev testing -- to add to checklist
	 ability to comment/reply
	 ability to add/mod repos for version control/branch policy

	the steps are used to have consistency, to make sure critical items 
	 aren't missed/skipped during the setup/dev/release/prod/post morteum
	 phases

	the idea is to map the checklists for the differnt parts of the 
	app create process, to the overall schedule.
 
	the overall TestCheckList might work with a projmgmt app as well
	-the TestCheckList works with the other "checklist" apps
