/tmp/ghubRepoTest/WebAppFolder/projName/projNameOverview.txt \

	describes the overall goal of the webApp/proj/projName - files
	contains the "projName"  files - if required (would be what??)
	--ie "wave"

	folder would require all sub folders/files for the "app" proj
	as example

	database
	docs
	resources/views
	routes
	src

	..for the "wave" app...

	the dir follows the "dojo / wave" app..
	for other apps, this might have different structure/subdirs/files

	for most apps/template, prob need to define the subdir/structure/files 
	 for the "proj" subdir...

	up to the dev/dev team to create the layout, 
	 for what works with the proj

	once the structure/layout is "created"
	add it to the githb repos
	
	describe the subdirs files/processes, what it is, how it works, etc..
	etc.. 

	comments/docs for the subdir/files


	description/comments/docs for the subfolders/files to 
	 give user understanding of how/why flow/logic of "storage" part of project

not exactly sure what this should be..
 look at the dojo wave -to see how/what this folder/file is..

"projName" would be the appName
 folder would have the subdirs of the proj, 
	as well as any required files
