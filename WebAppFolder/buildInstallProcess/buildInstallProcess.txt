/tmp/ghubRepoTest/WebAppFolder/buildInstallProcess/buildInstallProcess.txt \

	describes the overall goal of the 
	 webApp/buildInstallProcess/buildInstallProcess.txt - files
	contains the "buildInstallProcess.txt"  files 
	-scripts to be able to build/install/run the app
	-what's required to setup the dev env, the required dev files, 
	 the required system/ops processes..
	-complete steps for cloning from the github repos
	 to getting the process to a clone/cloud/instance to be 
	 able to run the app to test
	-used to have a consistent testing harness
	-might be used to setup a container/docker/clone etc..
	-the idea is to get/have/create a complete harness
	 to run run the app, as well as test the app
	-at the same time, tie the "harness" build process to 
	 the testing process

	-have all steps/files/processes needed/to build the 
	 app

	description/comments/docs for the subfolders/storage to 
	 give user understanding of how/why flow/logic of "storage" part of project

not exactly sure what this should be..
 look at the dojo wave -to see how/what this folder/file is..
